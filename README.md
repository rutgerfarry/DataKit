# DataKit :deciduous_tree:
Common algorithms and data structures, implemented in Swift.

I'm currently writing this for coding interview practice / general interest. Not intended for production use, but that might change one day. Since this is a personal learning project, I'm not accepting pull requests for new algorithms / data structures, but suggestions are welcome!

## Roadmap
### Sorts
- [X] Insertion Sort
- [ ] Quicksort
- [ ] Merge Sort

### Other Algorithms
- [ ] Djikstra's Algorithm
- [ ] Knapsack Problems

### Data Structures
- [ ] Singly-Linked List
- [ ] Doubly-Linked List
- [ ] Stack and Queue
- [ ] Simple Binary Tree
- [ ] AVL Tree
- [ ] Undirected Weighted Graph
- [ ] Directed Weighted Graph

### Machine Learning
- [ ] Naive Bayesian Network

More to come! If you have any suggestions, please file an issue :smile:
